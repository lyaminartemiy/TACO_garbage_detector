# Garbage Detector (Project for [Deep Learning School](https://dls.samcs.ru))

### Brief description of the project
> Development of an automatic garbage detector on images.
> - 29 classes for detection.
> - Fine-tuning `Faster R-CNN` was used.
> - Using the `Streamlit Cloud` to create a web interface and test a trained model

### Image Dataset
> [tacodataset.org](http://tacodataset.org) - is an open image dataset of waste in the wild. It contains photos of litter taken under diverse environments, from tropical beaches to London streets. These images are manually labeled and segmented according to a hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms.
